# Chest-X-ray-CNN

A classification model using Covolutional Neural Network for pneumonia

different Retinal Diseases using Deep Learning from Optical Coherence Tomography Images. This code is part of the supplementary materials for the IEEE ICMLA 2019 for our paper Optic-net: A Novel Convolutional Neural Network for Diagnosis of Retinal Diseases from Optical Tomography Images. The paper has since been accpeted to IEEE ICMLA 2019 and will be preseneted in December 2019.
